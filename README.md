# Keylogger Tool

## Description

This project implements a *Keylogger* in Python. The keylogger is a tool that monitors and records keystrokes on the system and saves the logged data in a secure file. It is useful for educational purposes, learning about how keystrokes are captured programmatically, or for developing security tools. This tool should only be used in an ethical and legal manner, and it is essential to ensure that you have permission to run it on any system.
